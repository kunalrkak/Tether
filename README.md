# Calhacks2016
This is the repository that holds the code for our app for CalHacks 3.0 called Tether. Weâ€™ve designed a simple, intuitive app that makes going out with your friends safer; the app creates a group for you and your friends, and alerts everyone when a group member strays outside of a pre-determined safety radius.

For any questions regarding the function of this application, contact any of the following people workng on the application (all email address are @berkeley.edu):
